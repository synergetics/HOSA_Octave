%          BICOHERX - cross-bicoherence estimation  (direct method) 
%
% The cross-bicoherence between three processes, x,y and z, is defined by 
%
%  BICxyz (f1,f2) =  Bxyz(f1,f2) / sqrt{ Sxx(f1) Syy(f2) Szz(f1+f2) } 
%
% where Bxyz is the cross-bispectrum, and Sxx, Syy, Szz are the power spectra 
%
% The cross-bicoherence  will be zero if the three processes are jointly
%  symmetric distributed.
% A constant value of the cross-bicoherence is indicative of joint linear 
% relationships; 
% a non-constant value is indicative of non-linear relationships.

% We will compute the cross-bicoherence between the inputs and outputs of
% a second-order Volterra system. 
% The data for the demo consist of the inputs, x, and outputs,y, of a 
% second-order Voltera system,
%   y(n) = sum_{k=0 to 11} h(k) x(n-k) 
%        + sum_{k=0 to 11} q(k,l) x(n-k)x(n-l)
% The filters h and q were generated via,
%   h = fir1(11,0.4); g = fir1(11,0.2);  q = g(:) * g(:)'
% A white Gaussian process, generated via RPIID, was chosen for x;
% and the outputs, y, were computed via NLGEN.
